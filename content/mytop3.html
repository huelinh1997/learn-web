		<h2>Wildflowers</h2>
		<p >A wildflower (or wild flower) is a flower that grows in the wild, meaning it was not intentionally seeded or planted. Yet "wildflower" meadows of a few mixed species are sold in seed packets. The term implies that the plant probably is neither a hybrid nor a selected cultivar that is in any way different from the way it appears in the wild as a native plant, even if it is growing where it would not naturally. The term can refer to the flowering plant as a whole, even when not in bloom, and not just the flower.</p>

		<h2>Lavender flowers</h2>
		<p>Lavender seems to be everywhere -- in kitchen cabinets, soaps and sachets, herb gardens and even medicine chests. Humans just cannot seem to get enough of this beautiful, aromatic plant. But does lavender pose a threat to our beloved felines? Reliable authorities indicate that lavender, in moderation, is safe.</p>

		<h2>Sunflower</h2>
		<p >Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the few crop species that originated in North America (most originated in the fertile crescent, Asia or South or Central America). It was probably a "camp follower" of several of the western native American tribes who domesticated the crop (possibly 1000 BC) and then carried it eastward and southward of North America. The first Europeans observed sunflower cultivated in many places from southern Canada to Mexico.</p>
